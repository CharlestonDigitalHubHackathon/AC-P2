What’s the World’s Deadliest Natural Phenomenon?

HEAT WAVES

You should know:

•	Without HUGE action on climate, we may have a 3- to 4-degree Celsius temperature increase this century.  

•	This means will face longer and more intense heat waves.

CA-P2 zeroed in on temperature – looking at the increase instances of heat around the world. We created a “fun” tool that uses historic data to showcase future temperatures.


Before using this tool…
WHY YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT HEAT WAVES

•	Heat waves lower economic growth, you may lose your job.
•	Hot weather (and droughts) hurt agriculture, you might not be able to eat.
•	People working in factories on a 105-degree day with no air conditioning slow down . 
•	You run your AC, your bills go up. 
•	Your flights will be delayed as heat makes it necessary to space out flight take-offs. 
•	You face increased risk of heat-related mortality and illness

Before You Panic, Let’s Review 
WHAT YOU CAN DO?

•	Prepare for Heat Advisory Days (like you do for other natural disasters).
•	Live in homes with heat-deflecting building materials. 
•	Pay attention to the news – listen for the heat warnings. (Learn about climate change too…)
•	Stay hydrated – drink water before you get thirsty. 
•	Never leave children or pets alone in enclosed vehicles.
•	Consider your fashion choices…Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing. 
•	Vote for government officials that understand science and technology and can apply this understanding to build real, practical climate policy solutions!
